- [ ] Ghostty?
- [ ] Somehow evaluate every package that is used and diff that in diff-protected
    - Looks like this could potentially be done using `nix build --dry-build -vvv` and grepping for nixpkgs
- [ ] Figure out method to update regularly without breaking things that break often.
    - Sort things into "needs update" and "doesn't need update" baskets
- [ ] Figure out how to close yazi nvim using escape key
- [ ] Build home manager derivation for docker at main NixOS build time rather than at container run time
    - Need to make sure it still works on non nixos systems though
- [ ] Make it so you can run the docker container easily (alias)
