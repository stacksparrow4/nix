- [ ] Sandbox browser properly
    - https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/b6a8526db03f735b89dd5ff348f53f752e7ddc8e/pkgs/applications/networking/browsers/chromium/common.nix#L671
- [ ] Figure out why the build is really slow
    - Probably because it builds multiple "systems". The sandboxed systems are also systems.
    - Is there a way to get around this? (Maybe we can piggy back our host system home manager stuff?)
- [ ] Ghostty?
- [ ] Somehow evaluate every package that is used and diff that in diff-protected
    - Looks like this could potentially be done using `nix build --dry-build -vvv` and grepping for nixpkgs
- [ ] Figure out method to update regularly without breaking things that break often.
    - Sort things into "needs update" and "doesn't need update" baskets
- [ ] Build home manager derivation for docker at main NixOS build time rather than at container run time
    - Need to make sure it still works on non nixos systems though
- [ ] Make it so you can run the docker container easily (alias)
- [ ] Sandbox browser (docker container + mounts + x11 forward)
- [ ] Sandbox Burp Suite (...)
